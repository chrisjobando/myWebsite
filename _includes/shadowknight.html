I used Mega Man and Super </ad><ad>Mario Bros. as inspiration for the sidescroller gameplay.

My full CS2261 </ad><ad>class folder is available on GitHub with several other GameBoy assignments, labs, and </ad><ad>homeworks that I completed during the course.					</ad></p><p> I was pleased with this simple game matching the mental image I had for it, but in the <ad>future I want to create another game in C++ or Java using similar concepts. My next game </ad><ad>project will be either a Turn-Based Strategy game or a simple RPG. I really enjoyed </ad><ad>making Pixel Art and want to work on another project that uses sprites.</ad></p></div></div></div></section>
