<section class="aboutme"><div class="flex flex--center"><div class="col-80"><div class="rect"><p class="home-lead">Hey! My name is <span class="skill">Christopher</span><ad>.</ad></p><p>I'm a second-year <span class="skill">Computer Science</span><ad> major at </ad><span class="skill">Georgia Tech</span><ad>, with a minor in </ad><span class="skill">Film & Media Studies</span><ad>.</ad></p><p>Growing up as a first-generation <span class="skill">Hispanic-American</span><ad> right outside of DC, I felt trapped within a community with few public resources and fewer means of growth for those who did not take risks. I looked to </ad><span class="skill">music</span><ad> and </ad><span class="skill">television</span><ad> as a means of escape from reality. The amazing production in the music videos I watched and films I saw inspired me to pursue a career in </ad><span class="skill">computer graphic design</span><ad>.</ad></p><p>The wonders of seeing the dinosaurs in Jurrasic Park or the pod-racing scene in The Phantom Menace or my favorite childhood hero, Spider-Man, swing across New York City through the use of <span class="skill">CGI</span><ad> gave me a sense of wonder and joy that I needed during rough times. I aim to one day create that same feeling for others through </ad><span class="skill">my digital creations</span><ad>.</ad></p><p>I arrived at Georgia Tech with a strong <span class="skill">passion</span><ad> for technology but was unsure what courses best fit my interests. When I found out about the </ad><span class="skill">Media</span><ad> and </ad><span class="skill">People</span><ad> threads for Computer Science, I made the switch halfway through my first semester to Computer Science to improve my basic programming skills. I wanted to learn </ad><span class="skill">how to turn code that I develop into an experience for users</span><ad>.</ad></p><p>In the upcoming semesters, I am taking <span class="skill">high-level UI/UX CS</span><ad> courses as well as </ad><span class="skill">3D design</span><ad> courses offered by the School of Industrial Design. This, combined with </ad><span class="skill">production skills</span><ad> from my Film Studies Minor, will aid me in a career in </ad><span class="skill">3D Animation</span><ad> and/or </ad><span class="skill">Digital Media Production.</span></p><p>In my free time, I enjoy listening to indie R&B music and playing guitar/singing at open-mic nights in the GT Student Center. I consider myself a film-buff and an amateur filmmaker. <span class="skill">I am currently working on a new short film this year!</span><ad> I also am always sketching on my notepad, and am working towards publishing more of my illustrations online.</ad></p></div></div></div></section>
