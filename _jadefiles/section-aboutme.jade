				p.home-lead Hey! My name is 
					span.skill Christopher
					ad .
				p I'm a second-year 
					span.skill Computer Science
					ad  major at 
					span.skill Georgia Tech
					ad , with a minor in 
					span.skill Film & Media Studies
					ad .

				p Growing up as a first-generation 
					span.skill Hispanic-American
					ad  right outside of DC, I felt trapped within a community with few public resources and fewer means of growth for those who did not take risks. I looked to 
					span.skill music
					ad  and 
					span.skill television
					ad  as a means of escape from reality. The amazing production in the music videos I watched and films I saw inspired me to pursue a career in 
					span.skill computer graphic design
					ad .

				p The wonders of seeing the dinosaurs in Jurrasic Park or the pod-racing scene in The Phantom Menace or my favorite childhood hero, Spider-Man, swing across New York City through the use of 
					span.skill CGI
					ad  gave me a sense of wonder and joy that I needed during rough times. I aim to one day create that same feeling for others through 
					span.skill my digital creations
					ad .

				p I arrived at Georgia Tech with a strong 
					span.skill passion
					ad  for technology but was unsure what courses best fit my interests. When I found out about the 
					span.skill Media
					ad  and 
					span.skill People
					ad  threads for Computer Science, I made the switch halfway through my first semester to Computer Science to improve my basic programming skills. I wanted to learn 
					span.skill how to turn code that I develop into an experience for users
					ad .

				p In the upcoming semesters, I am taking 
					span.skill high-level UI/UX CS
					ad  courses as well as 
					span.skill 3D design
					ad  courses offered by the School of Industrial Design. This, combined with 
					span.skill production skills
					ad  from my Film Studies Minor, will aid me in a career in 
					span.skill 3D Animation
					ad  and/or 
					span.skill Digital Media Production.

				p In my free time, I enjoy listening to indie R&B music and playing guitar/singing at open-mic nights in the GT Student Center. I consider myself a film-buff and an amateur filmmaker. 
					span.skill I am currently working on a new short film this year!
					ad  I also am always sketching on my notepad, and am working towards publishing more of my illustrations online.
