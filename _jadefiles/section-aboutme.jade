				p.home-lead Hey! My name is Christopher.
				p I'm a second-year Computer Science major at Georgia Tech, with a minor in Film & Media Studies.

				p Growing up as a first-generation Hispanic-American right outside of DC, I felt trapped within a community with few public resources and fewer means of growth for those who did not take risks. I looked to music and television as a means of escape from reality. The amazing production in the music videos I watched and films I saw inspired me to pursue a career in computer graphic design.

				p The wonders of seeing the dinosaurs in Jurrasic Park or the pod-racing scene in The Phantom Menace or my favorite childhood hero, Spider-Man, swing across New York City through the use of CGI gave me a sense of wonder and joy that I needed during rough times. I aim to one day create that same feeling for others through my digital creations.

				p I arrived at Georgia Tech with a strong passion for technology but was unsure what courses best fit my interests. When I found out about the Media and People threads for Computer Science, I made the switch halfway through my first semester to Computer Science to improve my basic programming skills. I wanted to learn how to turn code that I develop into an experience for users.

				p In the upcoming semesters, I am taking high-level UI/UX CS courses as well as 3D design courses offered by the School of Industrial Design. This, combined with production skills from my Film Studies Minor, will aid me in a career in 3D Animation and/or Digital Media Production.

				p In my free time, I enjoy listening to indie R&B music and playing guitar/singing at open-mic nights in the GT Student Center. I consider myself a film-buff and an amateur filmmaker. I am currently working on a new short film this year! I also am always sketching on my notepad, and am working towards publishing more of my illustrations online.
